% The role of subglacial topography on Antarctic ice flow

\section*{Abstract}

To examine the influence of bed topography on ice motion, we conduct an inversion experiment using two beds with different spatial resolutions - the $\SI{250}{\metre}$ resolution DeepBedMap\_DEM and the $\SI{500}{\metre}$ resolution BedMachine Antarctica.
Two components balance the driving stress of a glacier, form drag and skin drag.
We examine how an increase in form drag due to higher resolution topography effects the remainding skin drag component which is dynamically controlled by subglacial hydrology and bed material properties.
An iterative least-squares control method basal inversion is performed using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) with a Full Stokes stress balance equations and Schoof-type Coulomb-limited sliding law.
Comparison of inverted fields between DeepBedMap\_DEM and BedMachine Antarctica appear to be within the one sigma error margin, though both basal drag and slipperiness fields are slightly higher while effective pressure is generally lower when using the higher-resolution DeepBedMap\_DEM.
Previous inversion studies using a Weertman-style sliding relation over Pine Island Glacier indicated that high resolution bed topography reduced skin drag, a conclusion that is not supported in this work.
These findings warrant more effort into the investigation of time-dependent subglacial hydrology which influences skin drag, alongside the use of higher resolution bed topographies ($<= \SI{100}{\metre}$) which influences form drag, over more diverse subglacial settings in West Antarctica.


\section{Introduction}

The bed topography of Antarctica is a critical parameter in ice sheet modelling studies as it affects basal slip - the combined motion of ice from sliding and bed deformation \citep[][p.223]{Cuffeyphysicsglaciers2010}.
Understanding the slip relation is important as it remains one of the biggest uncertainties in our determination of the Antarctic ice sheet's contribution to sea level rise \citep[e.g.][]{RitzPotentialsealevelrise2015,BulthuisUncertaintyquantificationmulticentennial2019}.
Basal properties vary spatially, and are often determined via inverse methods which use ice surface observations coupled with ice physics to solve for critical basal parameters for ice sheet modelling \citep[e.g.][]{MacAyealbasalstressdistribution1992,JoughinBasalconditionsPine2009,MorlighemInversionbasalfriction2013} and for resolving bed topography \citep[e.g.][]{MorlighemDeepglacialtroughs2019,LeongDeepBedMapdeepneural2020}.
These indirect empirical methods are used because sampling subglacial sediments under the Antarctic ice sheet is logistically challenging \citep[e.g.][]{Siegertassessmentdeephotwater2014,TulaczykWISSARDSubglacialLake2014}, though having direct access to sediments would allow us to use physically based methods of quantifying basal slip \citep[e.g.][]{Zoetsliplawglaciers2020}.

This chapter explores the interplay between two components of frictional drag at the ice-bed interface - form drag and skin drag \citep{SchoofBasalperturbationsice2002,BinghamDiverselandscapesPine2017,Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018,Minchewuniversalglacierslip2020}.
In particular, we look at how a high resolution (\SI{250}{\metre}) rougher bed \citep{LeongDeepBedMap2020} compares with a medium resolution (\SI{500}{\metre}) smoother bed \citep{MorlighemMEaSUREsBedMachineAntarctica2020}.
The spatially varying basal drag of the bed can be worked out by using bed topography to calculate form drag \citep{SchoofBasalperturbationsice2002}, and then taking the remainder balance as skin drag which is determined by bed material properties and subglacial hydrology \citep{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018}. % TODO define how form/skin drag is partitioned
% A secondary objective is
In the following, we review two key parameters which ice sheet models are sensitive to - multi-scale bed topography features and sliding law relations.



% \subsection{Sensitivity of ice sheet models to basal parameters}

% The physical basis of basal slip over deformable till is provided by Equation \eqref{eq:3.1},~\eqref{eq:3.2},
% The effect of subglacial water on ice flow is likely geographically dependent, in that different basal conditions apply in different parts of Antarctica.

\subsection{Bed Topography}

\citet{DurandImpactbedrockdescription2011} performed a sensitivity analysis on different spatial resolution beds using a 2-D flowline model and suggested that a spatial resolution of at least \SI{1}{\kilo\metre} was needed to accurately model coastal outlet glaciers.
This was followed by the creation of BEDMAP2 \citep{FretwellBedmap2improvedice2013} - a \SI{1}{\kilo\metre} resolution Antarctic bed elevation model resampled from a \SI{5}{\kilo\metre} grid, which became the de facto standard for ice sheet models \citep[see e.g.][]{SeroussiinitMIPAntarcticaicesheet2019}.
However, there have been issues reported in relation to BEDMAP2's ice thickness at the former grounding line of Pine Island Glacier that did not respect mass conservation \citep{RignotWidespreadrapidgrounding2014}.
High resolution bed elevations are especially needed close to grounding zones \citep[e.g.][]{SchoofIcesheetgrounding2007,CornfordAdaptivemeshrefinement2016}, and there is a need for high resolution ($<= \SI{500}{\metre}$) bed elevation models that preserve topographic details, so that form drag - resistance to ice flow due to bed topography - is correctly accounted for \citep{BinghamDiverselandscapesPine2017,Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018}.
The limitations of BEDMAP2 have motivated the creation of higher resolution ($<=$ \SI{500}{\metre}) bed \gls{DEM}s with two important ingredients - large-scale topography that is consistent with mass conservation requirements \citep[e.g.][]{Morlighemmassconservationapproach2011}, and preservation of fine-scale roughness details \citep[e.g.][]{GoffConditionalsimulationThwaites2014,Grahamhighresolutionsyntheticbed2017}, both of which are needed to fully capture ice-sheet dynamics.

\paragraph{Long-wavelength details captured by mass conservation}

Ice sheet models include the physical laws of mass conservation (MC), and this can be used to invert ice surface observations into bed elevation \citep[e.g.][]{Morlighemmassconservationapproach2011}.
Using an ensemble of 2-D Shelfy stream approximation \citep[SSA;][]{MacAyealLargescaleiceflow1989} models, \citet{SchlegelExplorationAntarcticIce2018} performed a comparison of bedrock topography over the Antarctic ice sheet, and their informed bound (using regionally based boundary condition) experiments saw that using an improved BEDMAP2 mass conserving grid \citep[cf.][]{RignotWidespreadrapidgrounding2014} produced $0.3292\pm\SI{0.1019}{\metre}$ \gls{SLE}, while the older BEDMAP \citep{LytheBEDMAPnewice2001} grid produced a $0.1845\pm\SI{0.08834}{\metre}$ \gls{SLE} over a \SI{100}{\year} period.
This represents a mean increase of \SI{0.14}{m} \gls{SLE} from using the improved resolution BEDMAP2/MC grid, but also an 18\% increase in the \gls{SLE} uncertainty which suggests a wider range of grounding line retreat scenarios that has implications for ice sheet stability.
On a catchment scale, \citet{NiasNewMassConserving2018} produced a mass-conserving bed topography over Pine Island Glacier and found that modelled sea level contributions over a \SI{50}{\year} period was consistently higher using the mass-conserving bed (\SIrange{0.08}{0.10}{\milli\metre\per\year} \gls{SLE}) than with BEDMAP2 (\SIrange{0.04}{0.07}{\milli\metre\per\year} \gls{SLE}) irrespective of the sliding law used.
Since then, this mass conservation technique has been applied to other key outlet glaciers and ice streams in BedMachine Antarctica \citep{MorlighemMEaSUREsBedMachineAntarctica2020}, identifying new areas vulnerable to Marine Ice Sheet Instability such as at Ninnis Glacier in George V Land and Denman Glacier in East Antarctica which both rest on retrograde slopes \citep{MorlighemDeepglacialtroughs2019}.
This medium resolution (\SI{500}{\metre}) mass conserving BedMachine Antarctica grid \citep[version 2,][]{MorlighemMEaSUREsBedMachineAntarctica2020} will be used in our basal inversion experiment.

\paragraph{Short-wavelength details from spatial statistics}

% the super-resolution DeepBedMap\_DEM \citep{LeongDeepBedMapdeepneural2020}
Using an ensemble of L1L2 \citep{Hindmarshnumericalcomparisonapproximations2004,SchoofThinFilmFlowsWall2010} ice sheet models, \citet{SunDynamicresponseAntarctic2014} showed that the phase of low-frequency noise ($>\SI{10}{\kilo\metre}$) was more important than the phase of high-frequency noise ($<\SI{1}{\kilo\metre}$) of the same amplitude in their model projection runs.
Still, the ice sheet model was sensitive to the amplitude of the short-wavelength/high-frequency noise even if the phase of that noise was not so important.
Spatial statistical methods have since been used to retrieve this topographical noise along radio-echo sounding (\gls{RES}) transects and apply it spatially to a larger regional extent.
Over Thwaites Glacier, \citet{GoffConditionalsimulationThwaites2014} captured the different roughness statistics between highland and lowland parts, and applied it to the whole catchment using a conditional simulation method which allowed fine-scale roughness and channelized morphologies to be resolved better than ordinary kriging.
\citet{Grahamhighresolutionsyntheticbed2017} generated a synthetic high-resolution ($\SI{100}{\metre}$) grid using a two-step approach, with the low-frequency component derived from BEDMAP2, and a high-frequency component derived from radar point data from the Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (ICECAP) and BEDMAP compilation.
\citet{LeongDeepBedMapsuperresolutiondeep2019} used 2-D gridded \gls{RES} ground-truth data with ice surface observations of elevation, velocity and snow accumulation to train a super-resolution deep neural network model, using it to produce a \SI{250}{\metre} resolution grid of the Antarctic ice sheet.
This super-resolution (\SI{250}{\metre}) DeepBedMap\_DEM grid \citep[version 1.1,][]{LeongDeepBedMap2020} will be used in our basal inversion experiment.



\subsection{Basal drag}

% \subsection{Form drag vs Skin drag}

Form drag arises due to large-scale bed topography which opposes the motion of ice as it flows and deforms around obstacles on a rigid bed \citep[][]{WeertmanSlidingGlaciers1957,SchoofBasalperturbationsice2002}.
Skin drag occurs in relation to water, whose presence acts to lubricate the ice-bed interface and allow subglacial till to deform more easily \citep{IversonExperimentsdynamicssedimentary2015}, and also from bed material properties.
The physical mechanisms of these two processes may differ, but the mathematical formulation and parameterizations for both are similar \citep{Minchewuniversalglacierslip2020}.

\subsubsection{Physical basis of basal slip}

A basal slip law that relates basal drag or basal shear stress $\tau_b$ with effective normal stress (pressure) $N$ and basal slip velocity $u_b$ is given by \citet[][eq.1]{Zoetsliplawglaciers2020}:

\begin{equation}
  \tau_b = \min [ N \tan(\phi), (C u_b)^{1/m} ] \label{eq:3.1}
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the friction angle of the basal till, such that $\tan(\phi)$ is the friction coefficient, $m$ is a slip law exponent, and $C$ is a constant dependent on bed roughness and transitional velocity $u_t$ formulated as $C = \frac{(N \tan(\phi))^{m}}{u_t}$.
The approximate continuous form of Equation \eqref{eq:3.1} \citep[][eq.3]{Zoetsliplawglaciers2020} is as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \tau_b = N \tan(\phi) \left( \frac{u_b}{u_b + u_t} \right)^{1/p} \label{eq:3.2}
\end{equation}

where $p$ is a slip exponent, experimentally determined to be $\sim5$ \citep{Zoetsliplawglaciers2020}.

At low basal slip speeds ($u_b \to 0$) typically found over rigid, dry beds, viscous Weertman-style behaviour \citep[$(C u_b)^{1/m}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:3.1},][]{WeertmanSlidingGlaciers1957} dominates total drag $\tau_b$.
At high basal slip speeds ($u_b \to \infty$) found over water-saturated deforming beds, Coulomb-plastic behaviour \citep[$N \tan(\phi)$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:3.1}, e.g.][]{Schoofeffectcavitationglacier2005,JoughinRegularizedCoulombFriction2019} is more influential.
The upper bound of $\tau_b$ is based on the shear strength of the till, as determined from ring-shear laboratory experiments \citep{Zoetsliplawglaciers2020}.
Past the transition speed $u_t$, basal shear stress $\tau_b$ becomes independent of basal slip velocity $u_b$ \citep[c.f.][]{StearnsFrictionbeddoes2018}.
The physical formulation of Equation \eqref{eq:3.1} is similar to that of other Coulomb-based parametrizations \citep[e.g.][]{TsaiMarineicesheetprofiles2015,JoughinRegularizedCoulombFriction2019}, but while previous implementations fixed $C$ to estimate $u_t$ via inversion (\textit{a posteriori}), Equation \eqref{eq:3.1} is formulated on a physical basis with $u_t$ derived independently \citep[using clast size and till placement, see eq.2 in][]{Zoetsliplawglaciers2020} and then used to directly determine $C$ (\textit{a priori}).


\subsubsection{Sliding laws - linear viscous to Coulomb-limited}

% TODO throw in Coulomb sliding law review from \citet{NobleSensitivityAntarcticIce2020}

It is not feasible to access subglacial till across a glaciated area to physically determine $u_t$ (Equation \eqref{eq:3.1}), so parameterized basal slip relations are used in practice.
The choice of a basal slip relation or sliding law is paramount to ice flow modelling, as are its constituent parameters, all of which have been explored via sensitivity analyses in multiple ice sheet model comparison studies \citep[e.g.][]{SeroussiinitMIPAntarcticaicesheet2019,SunAntarcticicesheet2020,ZhangcomparisontwoStokes2017}.
\citet{Gillet-ChauletAssimilationsurfacevelocities2016} used surface velocity observations from 1996 to 2010 over Pine Island Glacier and suggested that a non-linear Weertman stress exponent of $m >= 5$ best matched observed flow accelerations, with the assumption that the basal slipperiness coefficient $C$ remained constant over the period.
In the Antarctic BUttressing Model Intercomparison Project \citep[ABUMIP;][]{SunAntarcticicesheet2020}, the ice-shelf removal or `float-kill' experiment (ABUK) noted how ice sheet models implementing linear Weertman/Colomb friction laws tend to show lower ice loss (\SI{3.07}{\metre} SLE) than models which implemented pseudo-plastic (\SI{4.41}{\metre} SLE) or plastic (\SI{10.20}{\metre} SLE) sliding laws.
Ice sheet models implementing such non-linear/plastic sliding laws generally lead to faster grounding line retreat than those using viscous linear sliding laws over the Amundsen Sea Embayment area \citep[e.g.][]{JoughinBasalconditionsPine2009,RitzPotentialsealevelrise2015,BrondexSensitivitygroundingline2017,BulthuisUncertaintyquantificationmulticentennial2019}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{chp3_fig_sliding_law_comparisons.jpg}
  \caption[Comparison of Weertman, Budd, Schoof and Tsai sliding laws]{

    Coloured iso-lines represent basal shear stress ($\tau_b$) values ranging from \SI{0.04}{\mega\pascal} to \SI{0.2}{\mega\pascal}.

  }
  \label{fig:sliding_laws}
\end{figure}

Other intercomparisons have judged the ability of different sliding laws to properly model grounding line dynamics, with overarching support for effective pressure ($N$) dependent sliding laws such as Budd-type \citep{BuddEmpiricalStudiesIce1979}, Tsai-type \citep{TsaiMarineicesheetprofiles2015} or Schoof-type \citep{Schoofeffectcavitationglacier2005} formulations instead of a classical Weertman-type \citep{WeertmanSlidingGlaciers1957} relation \citep[see Fig.~\ref{fig:sliding_laws},][]{BrondexSensitivitygroundingline2017,BrondexSensitivitycentennialmass2019}.
In particular, \citet{JoughinRegularizedCoulombFriction2019} noted how the effects of cavitation on sliding \citep[see][]{Schoofeffectcavitationglacier2005} appear important at Pine Island Glacier, recommending a regularized Coulomb sliding law with $m = 3$ and velocity threshold $u_o = 300\,\si{\metre\per\year}$ to reliably reproduce glacier behaviour in a manner applicable to both weak till and hard bedrock areas.
Coulomb-limited sliding relations are generally favoured, such as a Schoof-type law for its ability to transition continuously between Weertman and Coulomb sliding regimes in different settings \citep{BrondexSensitivitygroundingline2017,BrondexSensitivitycentennialmass2019,CornfordResultsthirdMarine2020,Zoetsliplawglaciers2020,Minchewuniversalglacierslip2020}.
Thus, we choose to use the Schoof sliding law \citep[adapted from][eq. 6.2]{Schoofeffectcavitationglacier2005}, presented below in a form similar to that of Equation \eqref{eq:3.2}:

\begin{equation}
  \tau_b = N C \left( \frac{\Lambda}{\Lambda + \Lambda_0} \right)^{1/m}, \Lambda = \frac{u_b}{N^m} \label{eq:3.3}
\end{equation}

where $\tau_b$ is basal shear stress, $N$ is effective pressure, $C$ is the Schoof friction coefficient less than the maximum bed slope (c.f. $\tan(\phi)$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:3.2}), $u_b$ is basal velocity, $\Lambda_0$ is a maximum threshold that satisfies Iken's bound (c.f. $u_t$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:3.2}), and $m$ is a power law exponent.
Equation \eqref{eq:3.3} will be reformulated as Equation \eqref{eq:schoof} in the Methods section to follow the ISSM \citep{LarourContinentalscalehigh2012} Schoof sliding law implementation.

\subsection{Previous work} % Relevance of basal roughness

\citet{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018} ran a Full Stokes ice sheet model inversion experiment with a Weertman-style sliding law on two different beds - a high-resolution (\SI{50}{\metre}) bed topography from DELORES data \citep{BinghamDiverselandscapesPine2017} and on a low-resolution (\SI{1000}{\metre}) BEDMAP2 \citep{FretwellBedmap2improvedice2013} - to compare the balance of slipperiness ($C$) and basal shear stress ($\tau_b$) estimates.
They reported that spatial patterns of both slipperiness $C$ and basal shear stress $\tau_b$ were similar across both high- and low-resolution experiments.
However, the magnitude of the spatially averaged basal shear stress $\tau_b$ was consistently lower when using the high-resolution DELORES \gls{DEM} than with the low-resolution BEDMAP2.
Over the iSTARt1 area for example, the high-resolution DELORES \gls{DEM} had $\bar{\tau_b} = \SI{6.8}{\kilo\pascal}$, low-resolution BEDMAP2 had $\bar{\tau_b} = \SI{9.6}{\kilo\pascal}$, while the flat bed control experiment had $\bar{\tau_b} = \SI{11.9}{\kilo\pascal}$.
The lower mean basal shear stress $\bar{\tau_b}$ was attributed to an increase in form drag introduced by the high-resolution DELORES DEM that induces more resistive stresses on ice.
The skin drag component must thus decrease, corresponding to a lower slipperiness $C$, in order for the modelled velocity to match the observed velocity in the inversion process.
The implications of this are that both basal shear stress $\tau_b$ and slipperiness $C$ may be overestimated for ice sheet models using parameterizations based on low-resolution bed topography models like BEDMAP2 \citep{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018}.
Here, we expand on the work of \citet{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018} by running a Full Stokes ice sheet model \citep{LarourContinentalscalehigh2012} using a Coulomb-limited Schoof-type sliding law \citep{JoughinRegularizedCoulombFriction2019,Schoofeffectcavitationglacier2005} over a larger spatial area over the main trunk of Pine Island Glacier.

% TODO paraphrase
% It therefore makes sense that the derived skin drag is consistently lower when more detailed bed variations are included in the domain; the form drag transmitted by the bed variations balances more of the driving stress.

\subsection{Ice Sheet model set-up}

% Refer to https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/12/3861/2018/ setup
% Also https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2020.8, ISSM model

\subsubsection{Stress balance model}

We use a Full stokes model implemented in the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model \citep[ISSM, version 4.18;][]{LarourContinentalscalehigh2012}.
ISSM is a thermomechanical finite-element ice flow model that follows physical laws for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy that is coupled with constitutive material laws and boundary conditions \citep{LarourContinentalscalehigh2012}.
Ice is treated as an viscous incompressible material \citep{Cuffeyphysicsglaciers2010} with a non-linear ice effective viscosity $\mu$ following a Norton-Hoff rheology law \citep[Glen's flow law,][]{Glencreeppolycrystallineice1955}:

\begin{equation}
  \mu = \frac{B}{2 \dot{\epsilon}_e^{(n-1)/n}}
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the temperature dependent ice hardness (rigidity), $\dot{\epsilon}_e$ is the effective strain rate tensor, $n$ is Glen's flow law exponent.

\subsubsection{Sliding law}

With ISSM, we applied a Schoof-type basal sliding law \citep{Schoofeffectcavitationglacier2005}:

% from https://icepack.github.io/notebooks/tutorials/04-synthetic-ice-stream/
% \begin{equation}
%   \tau_b = -\frac{\tau_0|u_b|^{\frac{1}{m} - 1}u_b}{\left(u_0^{\frac{1}{m} + 1} + |u_b|^{\frac{1}{m} + 1}\right)^{\frac{1}{m + 1}}}
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \tau_b = -\frac{C |u_b|^{m-1} u_b}{\left(1 + \left(\frac{C}{C_{\text{max}}N}\right)^{1/m} + |u_b|\right)^m} \label{eq:schoof}
\end{equation}

where $\tau_b$ is basal shear stress, $C$ is the Schoof friction coefficient (slipperiness), $C_{\text{max}}$ is a Coloumb friction upper bound parameter, $u_b$ is basal ice velocity, $N$ is effective pressure, and $m$ is a positive power law exponent (note that $m$ here is the reciprocal of $m$ in other studies \citep[e.g.][]{TsaiMarineicesheetprofiles2015}, i.e. $m = 1/m_{\text{Tsai}} = 1/3$).

The friction factor $C_{\text{max}}$ imposes an upper limit on $\tau_b$ which must satisfy Iken's bound \citep{IkenEffectSubglacialWater1981,GagliardiniFiniteelementmodelingsubglacial2007}:

\begin{equation}
  \tau_b \leq N\tan\beta
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the maximum local up-slope angle between the bed and mean flow direction.
Based on laboratory experiments \citep{IversonRingshearstudiestill1998}, $C_{\text{max}}$ is set to between $\tan \SI{10}{\degree} = 0.17$ and $\tan \SI{40}{\degree} = 0.84$, with lower values corresponding to clay-rich tills \citep[, pp.266-267]{Cuffeyphysicsglaciers2010}.
The spatial distribution of $C_{max}$ varies across a glacier but no method yet exists to constrain it, so a uniform value \citep[0.4 and 0.6 in][]{BrondexSensitivitycentennialmass2019} is used instead.
% The magnitude of $\tau_b$ has an asymptotic behaviour, tending towards $|u|^{\frac{1}{m}}$ at low ice velocities when $|u| << u_o$, but to $\tau_0$ at high ice velocities when $|u| >> u_o$.
The magnitude of $\tau_b$ has an asymptotic behaviour, such that $\tau_b \sim C u_b^m$ as $N$ trends towards infinity corresponding to a Weertman-type sliding regime, and $\tau_b \sim C_{\text{max}} N$ as $N$ trends towards zero corresponding to a Coloumb-type sliding regime \citep{BrondexSensitivitygroundingline2017}.

The effective pressure ($N$) can be approximated using ice overburden pressure:

\begin{equation}
  N = \rho_i g H
\end{equation}

where $\rho_i$ is ice density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration and $H$ is ice thickness.

% A Budd-type sliding law \citep{BuddEmpiricalStudiesIce1979} is applied with parameters $p=1$, $q=1$, % TODO check parameters

% \begin{equation}
%   \tau_b = -C N^r |v_b|^{s-1} v_b
% \end{equation}

% where $N$ is the effective pressure at the ice base, $C$ is slipperiness (friction coefficient), $v_b$ is basal velocity.
% r and s are defined as

% \begin{equation}
%   r = \frac{q}{p}, s=\frac{1}{p}
% \end{equation}

% where $p$ and $q$ are sliding law exponents.
% The parameter $s$ is similar to $m$ in a Weertman sliding law, and we set $p=0.2$ and $q=0.2$ to obtain an $m=5$ non-linear sliding law.

%TODO use m=8 (not 1) and see what happens

% \subsection{Inverting for basal conditions}
%
% % TODO cite MacAyeal 1992
% Inverse problems are common in glaciology \citep[e.g.][]{MacAyealtutorialusecontrol1993}, and involves determining the causes given some observed effects.
% We are deducing the state of a physical system, given an operator that acts to produce a set of observations we can measure.
% In this context, we can define the following terms:
% The model parameters $m$: These are the quantities we want to know but are unable to determine directly, though they can usually be constrained to a reasonable range.
% The forward model $G$: A mathematical representation of the relevant physics that maps the model parameters to some results we can observe.
% The data $d$: These are the quantities we can observe and measure with some degree of precision.
%
% The forward problem of having model parameters $m$ and passing it into the forward model $G$ to obtain data $d$ is straightforward and well-posed.
% For given model parameters $m$, there are unique data $d$.
% In contrast, the inverse problem of using the data $d$ and forward model $G$ to deduce the model parameters $m$ is difficult and usually ill-posed.
% This is because a specific data observation $d$ may correspond to many possible solutions for $m$, or there might not be a tractable solution, especially if $G$ represents a non-linear physical system.
%
% An additional complication is that the inverse solution to $m$ is very sensitive to small changes in $d$ that may contain errors.
% It cannot be overstated then, that the aim of inverse methods is not to find a set parameters $m$ that can fit the data $d$ exactly, but to find constraints on $m$ so that the model $G$ produces results that fits to data $d$ within acceptable error limits.
% Owing to the many solutions that an inverse method usually produces, there are often additional criteria that are used to reduce the number of possible solutions.
% Some of these criteria may or may not be explicitly stated, and it it necessary to be aware of these additional assumptions when dealing with inverse problems.
%
% In general, we can broadly categorize inverse methods as falling into two categories - regularization and statistical inference \citep[see][for a review]{GudmundssonInverseMethodsGlaciology2011}.
% The regularization approach attempts to find a solution for parameters $m$ that can fit to the data $d$ while being able to meet the demands of the regularization term's constraints.
% The statistical inference approach is often based on the Bayes Theorem, where the posterior distribution $p(m|d)$ of the state of the physical system $p$ given the data distribution $d$ is estimated.
%
% \begin{equation}
%   p(m|d) = \frac{p(m)p(d|m)}{p(d)}
% \end{equation}
%
% Either way, an iterative approach is usually used to solve these nonlinear inverse problems, specifically by minimizing or maximizing some given cost function.
% % TODO maybe change $p$ to $x$ and $d$ to $y$ and $G$ to $f$.
% With the regularization approach, the cost function to be minimized could be written as $|d|_a + |p - G(p)|_b$ for some function norms $|\cdot|_a$ and $|\cdot|_b$.
% With the Bayesian inference method, we wish to maximize the posterior distribution $p(m|d)$ with respect to $d$.
% Such problems are computationally intensive tasks, and most ways of effectively minimizing/maximizing the cost function require a way to estimate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters $p$.
% One of the first ways of calculating the gradient efficiently uses the adjoint state method \citep{MacAyealtutorialusecontrol1993}.
% Since then however, other heuristical methods \citep{Pollardsimpleinversemethod2012} and a technique adapted from electric impedance tomography TODO??? \citep{ArthernFlowspeedAntarctic2015} have also been used.

% % There is a strong motivation to study the basal conditions of the Antarctic Ice Sheet using inverse methods.
% Ice deformation is unable to account for the observed magnitude of fast flow along ice streams, and hence the study of basal slip is paramount to understand ice dynamics.
% Using readily available surface observations of ice velocity and ice elevation, and some a priori knowledge of the bed, we can invert for the mechanical conditions at the base of the ice sheet.
% Only by understanding the base of the ice sheet, are we then able to predict with some confidence how the ice sheet will behave in the future.
%
% A common exercise in ice sheet modelling studies is the need to initialize model parameters such that they are physically consistent with known observations.
% This initialization step has to take place before any prognostic runs or sensitivity analyses are undertaken by the modeller.
% The parameters that govern the basal boundary conditions are the most important to know in the case of fast flowing glaciers or ice streams where ice velocity is mainly due to basal slip.
% The extent of which the physics that govern the movement of ice flowing over the bed terrain is governed by a sliding law.
% This sliding law relates the basal sliding velocity $u_b$ with the basal shear stress $\tau_b$ (also known as basal drag or basal traction).
% As the parameters within the sliding law vary over geographic space, due to variations in water pressure, bed roughness, etc, they must be determined using inverse methods.

% \subsection{Inverting for ice rheology ($B$}

% The viscosity ice is another spatially varying parameter to be determined in ice flow models using inverse methods.
% The rheology of ice is nonlinear and polycrystalline glacier ice is a viscous fluid, with its viscosity being a function of stress.
% At such, ice is also known as a non-Newtownian fluid, or more speficially, a power-law fluid.
% Temperature also has a strong control on ice viscosity.
% We can formulate the effective viscosity of ice as follows:

% \begin{equation}
%   \eta = \frac{1}{2A\tau^{n-1}}
% \end{equation}

% where the effective viscosity $\eta$ is dependent on the rate factor $A$ and the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor $\tau$, with $n$ being the exponent in Glen's flow law usually taken to be 3.
% The rate factor $A = A(T)$ is dependent on temperature and other parameters such as water content, impurity content and crystal size.

% Englacial temperatures in ice sheets should in theory be easy to calculate, given accurate boundary conditions such as geothermal heat flux.
% In practice however, such data are not easy to source and contain uncertainties too great to be relied on.
% Instead, it is possible to put surface data observations into an inverse model, and let it obtain the spatial distribution of viscosity that will match up with surface ice velocity.
% The relative stability of ice rheology over short time periods means that we can use our estimates to conduct prognostic ice sheet model runs for decadal scale prediction.
% See also studies of inverse methods to deduce rheology applied to the Ronne Ice Shelf \citep{LarourRheologyRonneIce2005}, Larsen B Ice Shelf \citep{KhazendarLarsenIceShelf2007}, and the whole of Antarctica \citep{ArthernFlowspeedAntarctic2015}.


\subsection{Inverting for basal shear stress $\tau_b$}

To determine the spatial distribution of basal shear stress ($\tau_b$), we run an inversion using remotely sensed values of surface velocity $u_s$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:topo_and_speed}b).
Following \citet{MorlighemInversionbasalfriction2013}, we accomplish this using a least-squares approach involving a control method \citep[][eq. 6]{MacAyealbasalstressdistribution1992} which avoids the errors in $\tau_b$ caused by using a direct algebraic inversion approach \citep[e.g.][eq. 4, 5]{MacAyealbasalstressdistribution1992} which is more sensitive to un-physical interpolations of $u_s$.
The objective function or cost function \citep[$J$,][eq. 9]{MorlighemInversionbasalfriction2013} used to minimize the difference in modelled and observed surface velocities is formulated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  J(\boldsymbol{v}, \alpha) = J_{mis} + \gamma_1 J_{1} + \gamma_t J_{2}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{v}$ is ice surface velocity, $\alpha$ is the parameter being inverted (i.e. the friction coefficient $\ln(C)$), and $\gamma_1, \gamma_t$ are non-dimensional weighting constants.
The initial friction coefficient was set as $\alpha_0 = \SI{10}{(\pascal\,\year\per\metre)}^{1/2}$ for the model domain.
We set $\gamma_1 = 100$ and $\gamma_t = 10^{-7}$ following \citet{MorlighemInversionbasalfriction2013}.

The first term $J_{mis}$ is an $L^2$ misfit calculated as:

\begin{equation}
  J_{mis} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Gamma_s} (v_x - v_x^{obs})^2 + (v_y - v_y^{obs})^2 \,d\Gamma_s
\end{equation}

where $v_x$ and $v_y$ are modelled ice surface velocities (in the $x$ and $y$ directions), $v_x^{obs}$ and $v_y^{obs}$ are observed ice surface velocities from \citet{MouginotContinentWideInterferometric2019}, and $\Gamma_s$ is the ice surface domain.

The second term $J_1$ takes the squared natural logarithmic difference between $u$ and $u_{obs}$:

\begin{equation}
  J_1 = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Gamma_s} \ln \left( \frac{\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} + \epsilon}{\sqrt{u_{obs}^2 + v_{obs}^2} + \epsilon}  \right)^2 \,d\Gamma_s
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon$ is a minimal velocity used to avoid division by zero. This $J_1$ term accounts for the order of magnitude difference in ice flow speed that ranges from $>\SI{1000}{\metre\per\year}$ at ice streams to $<\SI{1}{\metre\per\year}$ in the slow moving interior \citep{MouginotContinentWideInterferometric2019}.

The third term $J_2$ is a Tikhonov regularization term which applies a degree of smoothness to the inversion:

\begin{equation}
  J_2 = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Gamma_b} \nabla\alpha \cdot \nabla\alpha \,d\Gamma_b
\end{equation}

where $\Gamma_b$ is the ice bed domain.

The inversion is computed by iteratively minimizing the total cost function $J$ until a convergence stopping criterion is reached.
The stopping criterion is set empirically as when the cost function output value reduces by $<0.1$ between successive iterations.
Further details of the inversion process can be found in \citet{MorlighemInversionbasalfriction2013}.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

We now present our results over Pine Island Glacier, comparing the medium spatial resolution (\SI{500}{\metre}) smooth bed \citep[BedMachine v2;][]{MorlighemMEaSUREsBedMachineAntarctica2020} with a high spatial resolution (\SI{250}{\metre}) rough bed \citep[DeepBedMap\_DEM v1.1;][]{LeongDeepBedMap2020}.
In the following, we show the inversted spatial distributions of each bed's modelled velocity ($u_b$, Fig.~\ref{fig:velocity}) is presented, effective pressure ($N$, Fig.~\ref{fig:effective_pressure}), slipperiness ($C$, Fig.~\ref{fig:slipperiness}), and basal drag ($\tau_b$, Fig.~\ref{fig:basal_drag}) fields.
For all the fields above, we also present a transect plot taken along the main trunk of Pine Island Glacier (Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}) and across flow (Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}).

\paragraph{Basal velocity ($u_b$)}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:velocity}, velocity $u_b$ is shown to increase from the upstream part of the glacier (A) to the downstream part of the glacier (B) near the grounding zone for both DeepBedMap and BedMachine.
The mean velocity ($\bar{u_b}$) for DeepBedMap\_DEM (\SI{613.8065}{\metre\per\year}) is slightly higher than that of BedMachine (\SI{551.8016}{\metre\per\year}), a difference of \SI{62.0049}{\metre\per\year}.
Spatially, the difference in velocity between the two beds appears to be greater near the grounding zone around point B (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}b).

\paragraph{Effective Pressure ($N$)}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:effective_pressure}, effective pressure $N$ is shown to decrease from the upstream part of the glacier (A) to the downstream part of the glacier (B) near the grounding zone for both DeepBedMap and BedMachine.
The mean effective pressure ($\bar{N}$) for DeepBedMap\_DEM ($\SI{1.3389e7}{\pascal}$) is lower than that of BedMachine ($\SI{1.3807e7}{\pascal}$), a difference of $\SI{4.1762e5}{\pascal}$.
The along-flow transect plot (see Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}c) shows that DeepBedMap\_DEM's effective pressure field over the grounding zone (near point B) is noisier than that of BedMachine.

\paragraph{Slipperiness ($C$)}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:slipperiness}, slipperiness $C$ (friction coefficient) is shown to increase from the upstream part of the glacier (A) to the downstream part of the glacier (B) near the grounding zone for both DeepBedMap and BedMachine.
The mean slipperiness ($\bar{C}$) for DeepBedMap\_DEM ($\SI{31.3923}{(\pascal\,\year\per\metre)}^{1/2}$) is slightly higher than that of BedMachine ($\SI{31.3291}{(\pascal\,\year\per\metre)}^{1/2}$), a difference of $\SI{0.0632}{(\pascal\,\year\per\metre)}^{1/2}$.
The along-flow transect plot (see Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}d) shows that DeepBedMap\_DEM is missing one slipperiness peak at X:-1588000 compared to BedMachine Antarctica, owing to an offset of one the ridges.
% The difference in slipperiness between the two beds is more pronounced near the shear margins of the ice stream.

\paragraph{Basal drag ($\tau_b$)}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:basal_drag}, basal drag $\tau_b$ is shown to increase from the upstream part of the glacier (A) to the downstream part of the glacier (B) near the grounding zone for both DeepBedMap and BedMachine.
The mean basal drag ($\bar{\tau_b}$) for DeepBedMap\_DEM (\SI{203.04}{\pascal}) is slightly higher than that of BedMachine (\SI{192.12}{\pascal}), a difference of \SI{10.92}{\pascal}.
Spatially, the difference in basal drag between the two beds appears more pronounced near the shear margins along the main trunk of the glacier (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}e).

% TODO difference map of the two

\paragraph{Transect along Pine Island Glacier trunk}

Transect plots are shown along the main trunk of Pine Island Glacier from upstream point A to downstream point B (Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}), and across flow from high elevation point C to low elevation point D (Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}), with DeepBedMap\_DEM \citep{LeongDeepBedMap2020} and BedMachine \citep{MorlighemMEaSUREsBedMachineAntarctica2020} both showing the same broad trends.
Modelled basal velocity ($u_b$) for BedMachine appears to fit closer to the ground-truth velocities \citep{MouginotMEaSUREsPhaseMap2019} than for DeepBedMap\_DEM (Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}b, Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}b).
Effective pressure ($N$) tends to be lower for DeepBedMap\_DEM than that of BedMachine across both transect lines (Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}c, Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}c), except for near the grounding line close to point B (Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}c).
Slipperiness ($C$, Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}d, Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}d) and basal drag ($\tau_b$, Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_AB}e, Fig.~\ref{fig:transect_CD}e) fields are mostly comparable for both bed topographies.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

% \subsection{Basal friction}
In Sect.~\ref{sec:results}, we show that the inverted basal drag ($\bar{\tau_b}$) and slipperiness ($\bar{C}$) over Pine Island Glacier is slightly higher for DeepBedMap\_DEM than BedMachine Antarctica, while effective pressure ($\bar{N}$) is generally lower.
This small difference in basal drag from using two different roughness beds appears within a one sigma error margin.
In particular, this result did not show a signification reduction in either basal shear stress $\tau_b$ or slipperiness $C$ when using a higher resolution basal topography as shown by \citet{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018}.
Several factors could account for this discrepancy.

Firstly, the \SI{250}{\metre} difference in spatial resolution between DeepBedMap\_DEM \citep{LeongDeepBedMap2020} and BedMachine Antarctica \citep{MorlighemMEaSUREsBedMachineAntarctica2020} is much smaller than the \SI{950}{\metre} difference between DELORES DEM \citep{BinghamDiverselandscapesPine2017} and BEDMAP2 \citep{FretwellBedmap2improvedice2013}.
This smaller resolution difference may mean that the differences in basal drag (\ref{fig:basal_drag}) and slipperiness (\ref{fig:slipperiness}) are less apparent.
It could also be a higher resolution ($<= \SI{100}{\metre}$) bed is needed \citep[e.g.][]{Grahamhighresolutionsyntheticbed2017} before the effects of form drag are significant enough to affect slipperiness $C$ and hence basal drag $\tau_b$.

Secondly, the use of a Schoof-type friction law in our inversion (see \ref{sec:methods}) instead of a Weertman-type sliding law \citep{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018} may mean that form drag from high resolution topography has less of an effect on basal drag $\tau_b$.
Following the logic of \citet{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018}, a more accurate, high-resolution bed topography model lowers basal shear stress ($\tau_b$), and theoretically, this would shift parts of glaciers flowing at a rate close to the transitional velocity ($u_t$) from a skin drag regime to a transitional or form drag regime \citep[see][]{Minchewuniversalglacierslip2020}. % TODO link to big picture intro figure
This logic implied that subglacial water which influences skin drag (related to slipperiness $C$) would play a less important role in ice dynamics if low-resolution bed elevation models are used, supporting studies where water may did not significantly lead to speed ups in ice flow \citep[e.g.][]{SmithConnectedsubglaciallake2017}.
However, observed velocities over most of Pine Island Glacier are $>\SI{100}{\metre\per\year}$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:topo_and_speed}b) which suggests a predominantly Coulomb-type flow regime, so the decrease in basal drag $\tau_b$ from using a higher resolution topography observed by \citet{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018} may be an artifact of using an unbounded Weertman-type sliding relation. % (TODO plot binary 1/0 map of where Coulomb behaviour exists), or add a 100m/s contour line
The use of a Weertman-style sliding law by \citet{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018} in their inversion experiments lacks a parameterization of effective pressure $N$, thus excluding the possible effects of water cavitation \citep{BuddEmpiricalStudiesIce1979,GagliardiniFiniteelementmodelingsubglacial2007} or ice flow over deformable till \citep{Zoetsliplawglaciers2020}.
Their Weertman stress exponent value of $m=3$ also differs from that of \citet{JoughinRegularizedCoulombFriction2019} who recommends using $m=8$ for a Weertman slip relation to best match observed velocity data over Pine Island Glacier.
It thus remains to be seen whether these findings by \citet{Kyrke-SmithRelevanceDetailBasal2018} of high resolution topography reducing skin drag can be generalized to a wider area of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.

% TODO make this paragraph fit in better and not look like it was copy-pasted
The inversion study here using a Schoof-type sliding relation on two beds with different spatial resolutions and roughness suggests that skin drag (influenced by subglacial water and bed material properties) cannot be ruled out as an important factor in ice dynamics when using a high resolution bed.
% \subsection{Future directions}
Future modelling work could include better parametrizations of effective pressure $N$, such as with an evolving subglacial hydrology model \citep[e.g.][]{SommersSHAKTISubglacialHydrology2018}.
A more thorough sensitivity analysis should be carried out to test different values of parameters such as $C_{\text{max}}$ in the Schoof sliding law, and also regularization parameters $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (or others) to see how basal drag $\tau_b$ may change in magnitude or spatially.
A prognostic forward model run using these high resolution bed elevation models with a Schoof-type sliding law and Full Stokes (or higher order) stress balance equations would also be useful to assess the potential effects of different basal traction and slipperiness fields on Antarctic grounding line migration and its resulting contribution to sea level rise.
